This project is a Chromium extension that removes the annoying blur (and the stupid message) from your grades in Canvas, a popular LMS among schools.
Ever been using the LMS website Canvas and got annoyed because it blurred out your grades after browsing for a while? This extension is the fix for you. This extension runs when you load Canvas and removes the blur effect from your grades, letting you see how well you did on that history paper or math homework clearly.
I've been working on this for a while and it's currently at version 4.5. It's safe to say that this is the last version I will release, so I'm finally putting it here.
You can download Focus for Canvas _FOR FREE_ on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/focus-for-canvas-remove-t/ihdpcfonbpkbbkmfbefahelibpmlmfie)!
